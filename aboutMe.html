    <h2>
      My personal interests
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      I know this isn't like a hobby or anything but my career is a personal interest to me so here you go...
      I’m currently going to UVU for a bachelor’s in computer science, specifically focusing on
      full-stack development, which this meaning I get to know how to do all sides of
      programming, not just one. This is was not my original goal as I did actually want to go
      to college, I actually went to a coding Bootcamp called Bottega to learn how to program,
      and they taught me a bunch of languages, but the main languages, I use today is React.js,
      Javascript, CSS, SCSS, HTML, Node.js, Python, and a bunch more. The main thing I loved
      about the bootcamp is they didn’t just teach me the languages and moved on but now I can
      go out and teach myself about other languages out there.
    <br>
      As I progressed along in my new career I hit a few blocks stopping me from progressing
      this being the main of “we won’t hire you unless you have a degree” stuff and this does
      make me upset that people do this with computer programmers, but it can make sense
      depending on the company, a lot of companies like Google, Microsoft, are all not requiring
      degrees anymore, but even with that I feel its best to go and get this degree and I can
      pick up some new skill sets along the way. So after college, I plan to just continue my
      career as a full-stack/frontend developer and gain more experience in this career.
    <br>
      So with stuff, I currently do while going to school is do my day job which I’m a frontend
      developer at a company called Rovitracker inc. We are a GPS company that monitors company
      assets, and I essentially handle everything the users touch on the platform. The other
      things I do in my free time is playing video games for sure, you have to have fun, but I
      also find programming my own projects at the same time is a huge factor in my life and I
      also find the enjoyment in creating things, it was one of the major things to drive to
      make this website for this mini biography. Also a reason for how long it took to make.
    <br>
      What makes me unique is I’m a developer, not everyone is a developer and I find it cool to
      say that. With that, I also see myself as a writer and an artist as what I write literally
      creates and brings art to life, and as a bonus makes life easier for us all. Composition
      means to me is how I can take things around me, and other creations I’ve created to go and
      create a much larger and in some sense a better creation. Being in this course, I hope it
      will help me structure how I write things not so much in essay formats but in how do I
      take from my small projects and build a more advanced project or refined project.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also love playing video games, I have played many games from RPG to MMO, and City builders.
      It depends on the gameplay to see if I like them. I have tried my hand at making video games
      and I hope to make a good one someday but none have been finished and that's a problem that
      I have suffered a lot from. I spend a lot of my gaming time playing with my wife, I'm so happy
      to find someone who enjoys playing games with me, and tries to get me to play games with her! 
    </p>

    <p>
      I also love taking care of my car, and I hope to one day own one of the Nissan Z generation cars.
      I love how they show the car off, and the design and sounds it makes. I'm not one who will die for
      it but it's more of a side interest.
